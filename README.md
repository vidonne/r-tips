Along the line are emoji-style faces, showing the non-linear progression of R knowledge over time. At first, a nervous face becomes a happy face early on in learning, then a &quot;grimace&quot; face at an intermediate peak before a steep decline (with an exhausted face at the local minimum). Then, a determined face charges back up a hill, reaching another peak with a &quot;mind blown&quot; face and text annotation &quot;join R community on twitter&quot; followed by another decline, but this time the faces look happy even though their &quot;How much I think I know about R&quot; value is declining."  />

Thanks to [erikaduan](https://github.com/erikaduan/r_tips) for the
inspiration of making a clean repo to help me learn more effectively.
