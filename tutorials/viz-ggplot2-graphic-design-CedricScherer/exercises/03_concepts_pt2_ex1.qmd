# Exercise 1

-   Have a look at the visualization in the folder `img/3-1-astronaut-viz` of the cumulative time that cosmo- and astronauts have spent in outer space. The data also contains information on the year of their first and last travel, respectively.
-   Together with your group, discuss which layers and modifications are needed to create such a chart with `{ggplot2}`.
    -   Note down the aesthetics, geometries, and scales used for each element of this graphic.
    -   What is the coordinate system? Have any adjustments been made?
    -   Which theme was used and how was it modified?

![A circular lollipop chart on a black background entitled "Travelling to Outer Space" visualizing the cumulative time cosmo- and astronauts have travelled through the outer space.](exercises/3-1-astronaut-viz/astronaut-viz-detail.png)

## Layers + Aesthetics

-   geom_point

-   geom_linerange

-   geom_text

## Scales

-   scale_x_continuous, scale_y_continous

-   scale_color_???, scale_alpha

-   scale_size

coord_polar with theta = "y"

Probably theme_vois with some background
