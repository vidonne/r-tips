# Exercise 2

-   Create a circular lollipop plot of reported bike shares per season.
    -   The data is not in the right format as there are no totals.<br>How can you solve it?
    -   Remove all legend elements (with a single line of code).
    -   How can you add the labels next to the starting point of each lollipop?
    -   How could you add a baseline?

## Data import

```{r}
#| label: preparation
library(tidyverse)

bikes <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/graphic-design-ggplot2/main/data/london-bikes-custom.csv", 
  col_types = "Dcfffilllddddc"
)

bikes$season <- fct_inorder(bikes$season)

bikes
theme_set(theme_light(base_size = 14, base_family = "Roboto Condensed"))
```

***Don't know where to start?*** In the folder `img/3-2-circular-lollipop` you'll find step-by-step charts.

## Circular Lollipop

```{r}
#| label: plot

bikes |> 
  group_by(season) |> 
  summarise(count = sum(count)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = count)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_linerange(
    aes(ymin = 0, ymax = count)
  ) +
  # ugly but simple
  # geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  # nicer way
  annotate(
    geom = "linerange",
    xmin = .7, xmax = 4.3, y = 0
  )  +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = season, y = 0),
    family = "Cabinet Grotesk", size = 4.5,
    fontface = "bold", hjust = 1.15
  ) +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = paste0(round(count / 10^6, 1), "M")),
    size = 4, vjust = -1, family = "Cabinet Grotesk"
  ) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  scale_x_discrete(
    expand = c(.5, .5)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 7.5e6)
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    plot.margin = margin(rep(-100, 4))
  )
