**Create a similar visualization at the one placed in `exercises/6-1-bikes-jitter` as close as possible:**

```{r preparation, warnings=FALSE, messages=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(colorspace)
library(ggforce)
library(ggtext)

bikes <- readr::read_csv(
  here::here("data", "london-bikes-custom.csv"),
  col_types = "Dcfffilllddddc"
)

bikes$season <- forcats::fct_inorder(bikes$season)

colors <- c("#987708", "#663399")
```
