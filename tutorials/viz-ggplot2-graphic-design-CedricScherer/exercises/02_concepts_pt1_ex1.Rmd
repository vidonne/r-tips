# Exercise 1

- Explore the TfL bike share data visually:  
  **create a timeseries of reported bike shares on weekend days**
    * Highlight day and night encoded by colors and shapes.
    * Connect the points of each period with lines.
        + What is the difference between `geom_line()` and `geom_path()`?
    * Apply your favorite theme to the plot.
    * Add meaningful labels.
- Save the plot as a vector graphic with a decent plot size.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = TRUE, warning = FALSE, 
                      dev = "ragg_png", dpi = 300, retina = 1)
Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "C")
```

## Data import

```{r preparation, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

bikes <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/graphic-design-ggplot2/main/data/london-bikes-custom.csv", 
  col_types = "Dcfffilllddddc"
)

bikes$season <- fct_inorder(bikes$season)

bikes
```


## Timeseries of reported bike shares on weekend days

```{r plot}

```
