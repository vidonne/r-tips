# Exercise 1

-   Explore the TfL bike share data visually:\
    **create a timeseries of reported bike shares on weekend days**
    -   Highlight day and night encoded by colors and shapes.
    -   Connect the points of each period with lines.
        -   What is the difference between `geom_line()` and `geom_path()`?
    -   Apply your favorite theme to the plot.
    -   Add meaningful labels.
-   Save the plot as a vector graphic with a decent plot size.

## Data import

```{r}
#| label: preparation
library(tidyverse)

bikes <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/graphic-design-ggplot2/main/data/london-bikes-custom.csv", 
  col_types = "Dcfffilllddddc"
)

bikes$season <- fct_inorder(bikes$season)

bikes
```

## Timeseries of reported bike shares on weekend days

```{r}
#| label: plot

g <- ggplot(data = filter(bikes, is_weekend == TRUE),
       aes(x = date, y = count)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = day_night),
            color = "grey80") +
  geom_point(aes(color = day_night,
                 shape = lubridate::wday(date, label = TRUE))) 

g +
  labs(
    x = "Weekend date",
    y = "Reported bike shares"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(
    base_size = 16,
    base_family = "Lato"
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.title = element_blank())

ggsave(here::here("exercises", "myplots", "02_concepts_pt1.pdf"),
       width = 9, height = 5, device = cairo_pdf)
