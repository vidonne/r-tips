# Exercise 1

- Have a look at the visualization in the folder `img/3-1-astronaut-viz` of the cumulative time that cosmo- and astronauts have spent in outer space. The data also contains information on the year of their first and last travel, respectively.
- Together with your group, discuss which layers and modifications are needed to create such a chart with `{ggplot2}`.
  * Note down the aesthetics, geometries, and scales used for each element of this graphic.
  * What is the coordinate system? Have any adjustments been made?
  * Which theme was used and how was it modified?
