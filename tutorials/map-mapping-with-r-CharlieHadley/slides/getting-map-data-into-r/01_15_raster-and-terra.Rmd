# {raster} vs {terra}

Both of these packages are designed for working with single layer raster GIS datasets.

- {raster} has existed since 2010 and is extremely widely used.

- {terra} has only existed since 2020 and (as of 2022) is very novel

  - {mapview} is not yet capable of visualising {terra} objects

# {raster} vs {terra}

It's difficult to combine both packages into the same script due to function masking.

# {raster}, {terra} and the tidyverse

Neither of these packages are designed for a tidyverse workflow.

- We can't use `select()` and `filter()` to extract parts of these objects

- We can't modify/add parameters with `mutate()`

# {raster} and {terra} examples

In the visualisation sections of the course I'll provide code samples in the `data/` folder for manipulating both `{raster}` and `{terra}` objects.
